                    <p class="content">I often find that in order to be captivating, a film these days needs to be
                        stressfully suspenseful or have a complicated story line. This film had neither, and yet
                        I found myself hoping it wouldn't end while at the same time, anxiously awaiting its conclusion.
                        I have to admit, I was distrustful of Burton as many of his more recent films have had
                        less-than-satisfying conclusions. Nonetheless, I went to see Big Fish (3 days before its
                        release in Canada) with no expectations and was astounded. This movie is an absolute treat
                        for our hearts, ears and especially our eyes with each cartoon/fantasy-like scene painted
                        with Tim Burton's reliable brilliance and magical touch. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and
                        Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year- he *is* Big Fish. But I
                        suppose that when you strip away the beauty, the doll-house sets and all the abracadabra of
                        cinematography and modern day technology, all you have is a very simple story, and therein
                        lies the heart of this film; that one can create their own legacy, "the story of my life."
                        Not through either extreme of extraordinary adventure or unbelievable lies, but through the
                        art of storytelling- and THAT is what this film is about. It is through our *stories* that we are immortal.</p>
